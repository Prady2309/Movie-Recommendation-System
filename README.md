# Movie-Recommendation-System
**Description:** Recommends movies on the basis of Overview, Genre, Keywords, Cast and Crew using cosine similarity scores.
**Dataset:** https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ (MovieLens)
**API:** https://www.omdbapi.com/ (For displaying the details of the movie)
Personally, I would suggest using a different dataset (IMDB etc.) if you are planning on deploying the recommender system. The TMDB API wasn't functioning during the deployement, which made me use OMDB API (Easy to use).
